# UltimateRanks
UltimateRanks (formally called ColorArmour in dev#1) is a simple plugin that gives people armour when they join based on their rank. Then, based on their rank, the armour will be a certain color. This is a rank and item join plugin all in one.

People's names go with ranks, Ranks go with colored armour, on player join, the player gets armour (configured in config!)

Upcoming Features:

- Players could recieve $items when they join. $items is whatever you specify in config
- The /setrank command
- Rank in chat

@Taki21 you would be good at this, but I wanna get it off the ground myself first

# THIS PLUGIN HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN STARRED THRICE!!!!!!!!!!!
